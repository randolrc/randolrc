I always thought death would be peaceful. You know - fluffy clouds, endless brunches, maybe a heavenly spa day or two. Instead, I'm sitting in the Afterlife Administrative Office, watching a balding angel shuffle through a mountain of paperwork while muttering about "proper documentation."

"So let me get this straight," I say, leaning forward in my uncomfortably rigid chair. "Because some methhead stole my 'Rest in Peace' plaque to sell for scrap metal, I'm now legally required to join the Skeleton War?"

The angel - whose name tag reads 'Gary' - adjusts his reading glasses and sighs. "According to Celestial Code 359.2b, all souls whose graves lack proper peace documentation are automatically conscripted into active military service. It's all very clearly outlined in the funeral home's terms and conditions."

"Nobody reads those!"

"Well, perhaps you should have." Gary stamps a form with unnecessary force. "Report to the Skeletal Forces Reception Center at 0800 hours tomorrow. And don't forget to bring your own calcium supplements - budget cuts, you know."

The next morning, I find myself standing in formation with fifty other unfortunate souls, all of us stripped down to our bare bones. Our drill sergeant, a particularly aggressive skeleton wearing a WWI helmet, marches back and forth, clicking his jaw in disapproval.

"WELCOME TO THE BONE ZONE, MAGGOTS!" he bellows, somehow despite lacking vocal cords. "You're here because you failed to maintain proper afterlife paperwork! The living realm is at war with the forces of improper burial documentation, and we are the last line of defense!"

A skeleton next to me raises his hand. "Sir, my grandchildren just haven't visited in a while to clean my headstone. Surely that's not-"

"SILENCE!" The sergeant throws a femur at him, which passes through harmlessly. "That's exactly what the enemy wants! Neglected graves lead to forgotten souls, which lead to CHAOS IN THE BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEM!"

Over the next few weeks, I learn essential combat skills like Synchronized Spooking, Advanced Rattling, and How to Keep Your Bones Together in a Strong Wind (it involves rubber bands). Our mission, apparently, is to haunt grave robbers and negligent cemetery maintenance workers until they respect proper burial protocol.

My first assignment is to patrol a small cemetery in Ohio. I spot a teenager attempting to pry a bronze flower holder off a headstone. Following my training, I emerge from the ground in a shower of dirt, bones clicking ominously.

"HALT, DESECRATOR!" I declare, reading from the standard-issue script. "PREPARE TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF- oh, hey Tommy."

The kid drops his tools. "Uncle Tim? They got you too?"

"Yeah, some guy stole my plaque last month. How's your mother?"

"She's good. Still mad about you leaving her that cursed music box in your will."

"That wasn't cursed, it was a limited edition Precious Moments collectible."

"It plays 'It's a Small World' at 3 AM every night."

"...Okay, maybe it's a little cursed."

We catch up for a while before I remember I'm supposed to be terrorizing him. I rattle my bones half-heartedly and moan something about eternal rest and proper grave maintenance. Tommy promises to stick to shoplifting from Walmart instead.

Later, back at the barracks (a cozy mass grave in Pennsylvania), I file my incident report. Gary from Administrative reviews it with his usual enthusiasm.

"Fraternizing with the enemy," he tuts. "That's going to affect your haunting performance metrics."

"Can't I just buy a new plaque and get out of this?"

"Ha! In this economy?" Gary stamps my report with 'NEEDS IMPROVEMENT' in bright red ink. "Besides, you signed up for the skeleton war's GI Bill. Only two more years until you qualify for free eternal rest!"

I slump in my chair, my bones rattling with despair. "Can I at least get better rubber bands? These keep snapping during jumping jacks."

"Take it up with Procurement," Gary says, already buried in more paperwork. "And don't forget Tuesday's mandatory workshop on "Proper Bone Hygiene and You"!"

I trudge out of his office, accidentally leaving behind three fingers and a rib. Death, as it turns out, isn't the end - it's just another bureaucratic nightmare with better dental benefits and worse elastic bands.

And so, if you ever see a shady guy at a graveyard eyeing a copper plaqueâ€¦

For the love of god, tackle him.
