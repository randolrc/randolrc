---TaleTeller v1.0---
    
Paste your story and hit the button! It'll auto-create pages and scroll the words on each page, making it a bit more fun to read than a wall of text.

 - Use the buttons at the top to change pages, or click on the text to go to the next page.

 - Left/right arrow keys should work too, spacebar will go to the next page.

 - Reload button on top left will clear the story to allow you to paste in a new one.

 - Play button will toggle auto-advancing to the next page after a delay.
 
 - Fullscreen button on top right will do what it's supposed to, unless it doesn't.
 
 - Works pretty horribly on mobile.
